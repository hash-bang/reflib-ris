AB  - Now early childhood professionals can choose the best culturally and linguistically appropriate assessments for Spanish-English bilingual preschoolers. With this one-of-a-kind resource, readers will get an authoritative roundup and analysis of 37 developmental assessments available in English and Spanish. For each assessment, readers will (1) get a snapshot of key characteristics, including age range, cost, domains measured, and time requirements; (2) evaluate major strengths and weaknesses; (3) easily compare English and Spanish versions across cultural, linguistic, and psychometric properties; (4) learn the basics of administration and scoring; (5) investigate technical data, including standardization, norming, validity, and reliability; (6) see if the tool includes adaptations and accommodations for children with disabilities; and (7) review the results of relevant studies that used the measure. To help professionals conduct the most appropriate and effective assessments, the book also includes research-based strategies and in-depth background information on early bilingual language development and assessment. An essential resource in research, clinical, and early childhood education settings, this invaluable book will help professionals choose early childhood assessments that accurately capture the abilities of young dual language learners.
